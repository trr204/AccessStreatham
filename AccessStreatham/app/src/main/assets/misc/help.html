<h2>How to use AccessStreatham</h2>

<h3>Main Page</h3>
This is the screen that you see when the app first loads. It displays a map of Streatham Campus. You can zoom in and out on this map, and move it around as you desire. Clicking on specific points on paths in the campus grounds will produce a pop up menu with three options. The first option allows you to set the chosen point as a starting point for a route, while the second option allows you to set the chosen point as a destination point for a route. The third option brings up a different page for incidents, which you can find more information about in the Incidents section below. There are also three floating buttons in the top right corner of the map. The top button will take you to a page for planning a route, the middle button clears any routes currently on the map and finally the bottom button focuses the map on your device's location, if you have both enabled location services on your device and given permission for this app to access the location services. A menu with additional options is found in the action bar, above the three floating buttons.

<h3>Route Planning</h3>
When planning a route, you can either set a custom source and/or destination (see previous section), or use pre-determined locations. The Route Planning page allows you to pick a source and destination location pair from a selection. Once this is done, clicking the Calculate button will prompt the best route for you to be drawn on the map from the main page.

<h3>Preferences</h3>
An option to set personal preferences exists in the additional options menu from the main page. Here, you can personalise the route calculation depending on your requirements. The settings you save will have a direct impact on how a route is calculated to provide you with the best-suited path for you.

<h3>Incidents</h3>
Users can submit incident reports through the pop up menus discussed in the Main Page section. The Incidents page will show any current incident reported at that location, and also allow you to report incidents at that location. These incidents will be taken into consideration when a route is planned. If you are using the app offline, then you may not receive up to date information about current incidents from other users. Incidents will appear as red dots on the map on the main page. If however you are using the app with an Internet connection, you can select the Check for Incidents option from the additional options menu on the main page to check for incident updates.

<h3>Buildings</h3>
Information about buildings on Streatham Campus and their facilities can be found by selecting the Buildings option from the additional options menu on the main page.
